</p>
		<h4>1. Kramya policy and other parties</h4>

Caution should be exercised by a Customer when considering providing any private information, especially when the Customer has left the Website.</p>
		<h4>2. Children's privacy</h4>
		<p class="privacy-para">Kramya has a policy of protecting the privacy of children. The Website and the general practices of Kramya are not intended or designed to attract children under the age of 18. Kramya does not collect personally identifiable information from any person we actually know is a child under the age of 13. Notwithstanding the foregoing, some persons under 18, or minors generally, may be in need to the Services of Kramya. In such circumstances, any and all information collected must be from the parent or legal guardian of the child. </p>
		<h4>3. Customer's private information</h4>
		<p class="privacy-para">A Customer may choose to provide to Kramya information which contains personal identifying information and medical and other healthcare information ("Customer’s Private Information"); this is treated differently than the Customer’s Public Information which may have been submitted with a request that Kramya post such in the Public Area of the website (such as blog entries, reviews, etc.). Customer’s Private Information may include, but is not limited to: first and last name, username and password, date of birth, gender, type of medical or other healthcare sought, preferred geographic areas, etc; email addresses may be collected and are separately addressed below. A Customer is not obligated to provide Private Information, however the absence of full information may affect the functionality of the Website and the ability to provide Services and, in such circumstances, Kramya may determine that a particular Customer’s registration is insufficient to complete. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Customer shall provide false Private Information. By requesting appointments with Providers, a Customer authorizes Kramya to transmit Private Information and other Customer information to the Customer’s selected Providers. In no event does Kramya sell or otherwise share Customer’s Private Information with third parties.</p>
		<h4>4. Kramya security protocols</h4>
		<p class="privacy-para">Kramya has established protocols for safeguarding all Private Information, with both physical and electronic security measures which are, from time to time, analyzed for utility. Although Kramya cannot guarantee that Private Information will never be stolen by third parties, it does use high standards of care to protect Private Information from unauthorized disclosure.
		<h4>5. Non-private information automatically collected from website users</h4>
		<p class="privacy-para">When the Website is accessed by Customers, whether or not registered, certain information will be automatically collected from and information deposited to the Customer’s computer. The items collected do not contain personally identifiable information and are intended to understand the Customer’s use of the Website, improve its functionality, and allow for customized experience. Types of such information may include:
			<h5><strong>A. Cookies</strong> </h5>
				<p>Small files which are stored on the Customer's hard drive to allow the Customer to avoid having to re-enter data when the Website is revisited; such data regards user preferences, history of pages visited, etc. A Customer may delete or block cookies. </p>
			<h5><strong>B. Traffic Data</strong> </h5>
				<p>The collection of a Customer's IP address, domain server, type of computer, type of browser, website from which a Customer came to the Website and to which a Customer may thereafter link, and similar information.<br>
				With regard to cookies, traffic data, and similar information, none contain Customer's Private Information or any other personally identifying information. Kramya may utilize such non-private information for its own research purposes and may share non-personally identifying information with third parties. </p>



		
		<h4>6. Communications from Kramya or third parties</h4>
		<p class="privacy-para">Kramya will utilize a Customer's contact information, including email and telephone, to provide Services. It may from time to time send to Customers appointment reminders, travel and other information, special offers, promotional materials, system upgrade alerts, notices of changes to this Agreement, and similar communications. Kramya may, based upon the preferences of Customers, provide email contact information to third parties which may offer services or products of interest to a Customer. All Customers shall have an opt-out right from having email contact information shared with third parties. Further, Customers shall have an opt-out right as to promotional and similar non-essential types of communications from Kramya. In the circumstance that a Customer desires to exercise this opt-out, contact may be made to support@Kramya.com. If a Customer desires to receive no communications from Kramya, the registration must be terminated.</p>

		<h4>7. Kramya contractors and assignees</h4>
		<p class="privacy-para">From time to time Kramya may contract with others to assist in maintaining the Website and providing Services (Kramya Contractors). In all such cases the contractors shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement, as amended. Under such agreements, including the covenants of this Agreement, Kramya may allow on a limited, need-to-know basis, access by Kramya Contractors to Customer's Private Information and other information. Kramya will employ the same standards of care to supervise the use thereof by such Kramya Contractors. No other entities other than Kramya Contractors shall be provided such access.</p>

		<h4>8. Legal demands for disclosure</h4>
		<p class="privacy-para">Although rare, Kramya may be required to disclose a Customer's information when required by law. In such instances, it shall reasonably endeavor to contact the subject Customer of a pending demand for information before compliance. In no event shall Kramya be liable for any consequences of its good-faith compliance in response to any written demand by or through a judicial or governmental agency authority. Should a Customer initiate proceedings to contest a demand, then the Customer shall be responsible for the attorneys' fees and costs incurred by Kramya in such proceeding. In the event that Kramya is compelled to make the disclosure before a Customer can be advised, then Kramya shall provide notice thereof as soon as possible thereafter. Notice shall be sufficient by dispatch to the Customer's email address of record.</p>

		<h4>9. Compliance of providers with legal privacy requirements</h4>
		<p class="privacy-para">Kramya does not provide medical or other healthcare advice, and collects only minimal information regarding a Customer which would be insufficient for healthcare decisions. A Customer will, if desired, be required by a Provider to provide directly such information as may be requested or required by the Provider (Customer Provider Communications). Kramya is not privy to such Customer Provider Communications. Further, Kramya does not investigate, verify, audit, or in any manner have knowledge of the processes and procedures employed by any Provider or persons affiliated with a Provider in managing and safeguarding Customer Provider Communications. The Customer acknowledges, understands, and agrees that the privacy policies of Providers must be separately secured and read. Any and all information of any nature, type, and extent given by a Customer to any Provider shall be at the sole risk of the Customer. Customer releases Kramya from any actual or alleged violations of law or privacy policies by any Provider or persons affiliated with a Provider.</p>
